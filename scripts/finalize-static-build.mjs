/**
 * Flatten the TanStack Start build into a static `dist/` that Blink hosting serves.
 *
 * TanStack Start's `vite build` (configured with `build.outDir: '.vite-out'`)
 * emits:
 *   .vite-out/client/   ← prerendered HTML + assets (what we want, STATIC)
 *   .vite-out/server/   ← SSR Nitro server (NOT used by Blink's static S3 hosting)
 *
 * Blink uploads `dist/` and serves `dist/index.html` (see src/constants/publish.ts
 * BUILD_PATHS['vite-react'] = 'dist'). So we copy `.vite-out/client/*` up into a
 * flat `dist/` and drop the server.
 *
 * Why build into `.vite-out` instead of `dist/` directly: Start's client build can
 * otherwise collide with stale publish artifacts. Building into a clean temp dir keeps
 * the production output deterministic; this script then replaces `dist/` contents with
 * only the current client artifacts. See skills/blink-hosting for the static hosting
 * model.
